Reflect: Adaptive Quizzes


Problem
	Oftentimes, especially in public education, students’ ability varies greatly, which causes difficulty in teaching. Students with lower abilities in one subject have difficulty staying up-to-date with the material, while higher-performing students are bored with the material. A traditional quiz has many limitations because such a quiz only reflects if a student did well or poorly in a subject, rather than giving a more detailed evaluation of what the student’s abilities are. 

Proposed Solution
	 We propose creating an adaptive system that will change the difficulty of questions based on how well an individual student performs throughout the quiz. Teachers will be able to define their own questions and difficulty levels, meaning that these instructors can have a better understanding of students’ individual successes and struggles in a given subject. The system can help encourage lower-performing students by showing them questions that they can understand, and giving them direction on how to improve. The system can help encourage higher-performing students by challenging them with more difficult questions.
